# GDP_Per_Capita_Across_OECD_Countries


Our analysis considered the relationship between GDP per capita and growth in GDP, education, the likelihood
of protests, industries, life expectancy, and net exports in 40 countries. Our analyses suggest that
GDP is associated with all of these factors except for net exports. Countries with higher GDP tend to see
lower growth, fewer protests, higher life expectancy, and a greater proportion of economic value added from
professional, scientific, technical, and administrative fields. However, our analyses were constrained by the
small size of the data set, variables that were not available for all countries or in all years, and departures
from normality in the data.
